# QNS-Lite
This repository contains the code for QNS-Lite, a simulator for quantum networks. This simulator is used for the simulations of the paper "Opportunism in quantum networks".
## Paper Results
To reproduce the results of the paper, open 'main.go' in the 'experiments' folder, and specify the experiment that you want to run. The experimental figures of the paper correspond to 'experiment1.go' up to 'experiment4.go', in the same order of appearance in the paper. The data of the table provided in the paper is gathered in 'experiment6.go'.

After executing each experiment, you can draw the plot by running the corresponding Python code in 'experiments/Python scripts'. The plot will be saved to 'experiments/Python scripts'.
